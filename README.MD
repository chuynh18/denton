# I am JC Denton

## What is this?
99.99% of this is just the tfjs [body-pix demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix).

Just messing around with this model to understand what's going on, because [I was never properly trained in its operation](https://youtu.be/LZwRXpLRyVs?t=20).

## How to use
The only difference over the standard body-pix demo is that I am JC Denton, and so are you.  First, allow webcam use.  Then, after the model loads, you can check the "showDenton" box at the very bottom of the control panel.  Congrats!  You're now JC Denton.

Performance may be choppy on lower end machines.
